# Java 8 Features

This repository contains a set of Java 8 Features programs includes lambda expressions, functional interfaces, method references, Java 8 Stream API, Optional class, Static method interface, Default method, and ForEach() method. The examples cover the following topics:-

## Lambda Functions
 
- Demonstrates the usage of lambda expressions with different numbers of arguments.
- Includes examples of lambda expressions with no arguments, a single argument, and multiple arguments.

## Method References

- A simple example showcasing the use of method references with the `forEach` method on a list of integers.

## Functional Interfaces

- Defines a functional interface with a single abstract method (SAM).
- Illustrates the use of static and default methods within functional interfaces.

## Optional Class

- Demonstrates the usage of the `Optional` class to handle null values gracefully.

## Stream API

- Shows the application of Java 8 Stream API for mapping, filtering, reducing, and sorting a list of integers.

## ForEach Method

- Simple examples of using the `forEach` method to iterate over a list.

## Default Method in Interface

- Implements a default method in an interface and provides an example of how it works in a class.

## Static Method in Interface

- Illustrates the use of static methods within interfaces, including a static method in a functional interface.
