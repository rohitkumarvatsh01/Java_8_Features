This repository contains a set of Java programs illustrating various aspects of functional programming using lambda expressions, functional interfaces, method references, and Java 8 Stream API. The examples cover the following topics:

## Lambda Functions

- Demonstrates the usage of lambda expressions with different numbers of arguments.
- Includes examples of lambda expressions with no arguments, a single argument, and multiple arguments.

## Method References

- A simple example showcasing the use of method references with the `forEach` method on a list of integers.

## Functional Interfaces

- Defines a functional interface with a single abstract method (SAM).
- Illustrates the use of static and default methods within functional interfaces.

## Optional Class

- Demonstrates the usage of the `Optional` class to handle null values gracefully.

## Stream API

- Shows the application of Java 8 Stream API for mapping, filtering, reducing, and sorting a list of integers.

## ForEach Method

- Simple examples of using the `forEach` method to iterate over a list.

## Default Method in Interface

- Implements a default method in an interface and provides an example of how it works in a class.

## Static Method in Interface

- Illustrates the use of static methods within interfaces, including a static method in a functional interface.

Feel free to explore each example individually and use them as a reference for understanding functional programming concepts in Java. The code is well-commented to provide clarity and understanding. Enjoy learning and experimenting with functional programming in Java!
